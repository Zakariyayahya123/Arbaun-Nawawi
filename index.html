<h1>HADITH 1</h1>
<h2>THEME: SIGNIFICANCE OF SINCERITY AND GOOD INTENTION</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and understanding and shows the balance between the internal and external
     states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam 
     revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because 
     the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is 
     one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this 
     hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is 
     clear and the Haram is clear and between them are doubtful matters”(1), and “Whoever innovates in this 
     religion that which is not from it will have all his actions rejected (by Allah).”(2)</p>

     <h3>الحديث الأول</h3>
     <p>عَنْ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَبِي حَفْصٍ عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ: 
        "إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ،
         وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا أَوْ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إلَيْهِ".</p>

     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>It is narrated on the authority of Amirul Mu'minin, Abu Hafs 'Umar bin al-Khattab, radiyallahu 'anhu,
         who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, say: "Actions are (judged) by 
         motives (niyyah), so each man will have what he intended. Thus, he whose migration (hijrah) was to 
         Allah and His Messenger, his migration is to Allah and His Messenger; but he whose migration was for 
         some worldly thing he might gain, or for a wife he might marry, his migration is to that for which he
          migrated." [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

<h1>HADITH 2</h1>
<h2>THEME: The Stages of the religion</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This hadith includes within it all outwardly actions and inwardly beliefs. The sciences of the Sharia’ 
    return back to this hadith due to it encompassing knowledge of the Sunnah. Hence, some of the scholars 
    have termed this hadith the Mother or Core of the Sunnah, just as Surah al-Fatiha has been termed the 
    Mother or Core of the Qur'aan, due to it containing the entire Message of the Qur'an.
This hadith is also known as Hadith Jibreel (Angel Gabriel) (as). The hadith tells the story of Jibreel (as)
 when he came to the Prophet (sas), asking a set of questions. The Prophet (sas) responded to those questions
  and then addressed his companions. There is a door called “Baab Jibreel” at Masjid An-Nabawi in Madina. 
  It is known as the door that Jibreel (as) came in to ask the Prophet (sas) these questions.</p>

      <h3>الحديث الثاني</h3>
     <p>عَنْ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَيْضًا قَالَ:
        " بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ جُلُوسٌ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم ذَاتَ يَوْم
        ، إذْ طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا رَجُلٌ شَدِيدُ بَيَاضِ الثِّيَابِ، شَدِيدُ سَوَادِ الشَّعْرِ، لَا يُرَى عَلَيْهِ أَثَرُ السَّفَرِ، وَلَا يَعْرِفُهُ مِنَّا أَحَدٌ

     وَقَالَ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِسْلَامِ.فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم الْإِسْلَامُ أَنْ تَشْهَدَ أَنْ لَا إلَهَ إلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ
     ، وَتُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِيَ الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومَ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجَّ الْبَيْتَ إنْ اسْتَطَعْت إلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا.قَالَ: صَدَقْت . فَعَجِبْنَا لَهُ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيُصَدِّقُهُ!"قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِيمَانِ..قَالَ: أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ بِاَللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ، وَتُؤْمِنَ بِالْقَدَرِ خَيْرِهِ وَشَرِّهِ.قَالَ: صَدَقْت. قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِحْسَانِ.قَالَ: أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ كَأَنَّك تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك.قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ السَّاعَةِ. قَالَ: مَا الْمَسْئُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنْ السَّائِلِ.قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ أَمَارَاتِهَا؟ قَالَ: أَنْ تَلِدَ الْأَمَةُ رَبَّتَهَا، وَأَنْ تَرَى الْحُفَاةَ الْعُرَاةَ الْعَالَةَ رِعَاءَ الشَّاءِ يَتَطَاوَلُونَ فِي الْبُنْيَانِ. ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ، فَلَبِثْتُ مَلِيًّا،ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا عُمَرُ أَتَدْرِي مَنْ السَّائِلُ؟.فقلت اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ.قَالَ: فَإِنَّهُ جِبْرِيلُ أَتَاكُمْ يُعَلِّمُكُمْ دِينَكُمْ ".[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]</p>

     <h3><i>Al-Hadithul-Awwal</i></h3>
     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:
While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee against his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam."
The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so."
The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman."
He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He said, "You have spoken truly."
Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you."
He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went of. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion."

<h1>HADITH 3</h1>
<h2>THEME: PILLARS OF ISLAM </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This hadith focuses on the five pillars of Islam. The Prophet (sas) describes the foundations of Islam
 as having been “built upon five.” These foundational actions are either of the tongue, heart or otherwise.
 Imagine a home above the ocean, with five pillars that reach to the ground to support the home above. That is
 the imagery that comes to mind when the Prophet (sas) talks about these five aspects upon which Islam is 
 built.</p>

         خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ الله وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدَاً رَسُوْلُ اللهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلاةِ، وَإِيْتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَحَجِّ البِيْتِ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ "".</p>

     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>On the authority of Abdullah ibn Masud (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of 
     Allah (peace be upon him), and he is the truthful and the believed, narrated to us:
     Verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother's womb for forty days in the 
     form of a drop, then he becomes a clot of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like 
     period, then there is sent to him the angel who blows the breath of life into him and who is commanded 
     with four matters: to write down his sustenance, his life span, his actions, and whether he will be happy
     or unhappy (whether or not he will enter Paradise).
     By Allah, other than Whom there is no deity, verily one of you performs the actions of the people of 
     Paradise until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has been written 
     overtakes him, and so he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and thus enters it; 
     and verily one of you performs the actions of the people of the Hellfire, until there is but an arm's 
     length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he acts with the actions
      of the people of Paradise and thus he enters it.

<h1>HADITH 5</h1>
<h2>THEME:Rejection of Evil Deeds and Innovations</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p> This is one of two hadiths that encompass the entirety of Islam according to scholars. The first is “Verily actions are by intention...” which addresses the internal aspect of practicing Islam. Everything we do should be with the intention of pleasing Allah (swt) and by purifying our intentions we accomplish a great deal in our religion.
     Scholars say that the acceptance of actions of Ibadah (worship) is based on the above two conditions:
     The intention - the action should be done with sincerity, for the sake of only Allah.
     It should be done in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him)</p>

     <h2>ARABIC TEXT</h2>
     <h3>الحديث الخامس</h3>
     <p> عَنْ أُمِّ المُؤمِنِينَ أُمِّ عَبْدِ اللهِ عَائِشَةَ - رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهَا - قَالَتْ: قَالَ رَسُوْلُ اللهِ : " مَنْ أَحْدَثَ فِيْ أَمْرِنَا هَذَا مَا 
        لَيْسَ مِنْهُ فَهُوَ رَدٌّ " رواه البخاري ومسلم، وفي رواية لمسلم " مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ ".</p>

     <p>On the authority of the mother of the faithful, 'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: 
     The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: He who innovates something in this matter of ours 
     [Islam] that is not of it will have it rejected [by Allah].[Bukhari & Muslim]In one version by Muslim 
     it reads:He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected [by Allah].</p>

<h1>HADITH 6</h1>
<h2>THEME: Protecting the Heart</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p>This hadith is very comprehensive. It covers so many areas of the Sharee'ah, Islamic law. 
     Imam al-Nawawi and many scholars consider this Hadith as one of four of five ahadith around which the
     entire religion of Islam is understood. This Hadith indicates that all matters are one of three types: 
     halal, haram and doubtful.</p>

     <h2>ARABIC TEXT</h2>
      <h3>الحديث السادس</h3>
     <p>عَنْ أَبِيْ عَبْدِ اللهِ النُّعْمَانِ بْنِ بِشِيْر رضي الله عنهما قَالَ: سَمِعْتُ رَسُوْلَ اللهِ ﷺ يَقُوْلُ: 
        (إِنَّ الحَلالَ بَيِّنٌ وَإِنَّ الحَرَامَ بَيِّنٌ وَبَيْنَهُمَا أُمُوْرٌ مُشْتَبِهَات لاَ يَعْلَمُهُنَّ كَثِيْرٌ مِنَ النَّاس،ِ فَمَنِ اتَّقَى 
        الشُّبُهَاتِ فَقَدِ اسْتَبْرأَ لِدِيْنِهِ وعِرْضِه، وَمَنْ وَقَعَ فِي الشُّبُهَاتِ وَقَعَ فِي الحَرَامِ كَالرَّاعِي يَرْعَى حَوْلَ 
        الحِمَى يُوشِكُ أَنْ يَقَعَ فِيْهِ. أَلا وَإِنَّ لِكُلِّ مَلِكٍ حِمَىً . أَلا وَإِنَّ حِمَى اللهِ مَحَارِمُهُ، أَلا وإِنَّ فِي الجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إِذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ
         الجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ وإذَا فَسَدَت فَسَدَ الجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ أَلا وَهيَ القَلْبُ) رواه البخاري ومسلم .</p>
     <h2>Transiletaration</h2>
     <h3><i>Al-Hadithul-Awwal</i></h3>
     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>On the authority of Abu 'Abdullah al-Nu'man bin Bashir (ra) who said: I heard the Messenger of 
     Allah(peace be upon him) say:"The halal is clear and the haram is clear, and between them are matters
     unclear that are unknown to most people. Whoever is wary of these unclear matters has absolved his 
     religion and honor. And whoever indulges in them has indulged in the haram. It is like a shepherd 
     who herds his sheep too close to preserved sanctuary, and they will eventually graze in it. 
     Every king has a sanctuary, and the sanctuary of Allah is what He has made haram. There lies within
     the body a piece of flesh. If it is sound, the whole body is sound; and if it is corrupted, 
     the whole body is corrupted. Verily this piece is the heart."[Bukhari & Muslim]</p>

<h1>HADITH 7</h1>
<h2>THEME: The Religion is Naseehah (Sincere Advice) </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p> This Hadith focuses on al-Nasihah, advice or sincerity. The Prophet (sas) says that the entire 
     religion is encompassed in the concept of nasihah and that the main pillar of the religion and its 
     soundness lies in this concept of nasihah.
     Nasihah is usually translated as advice, but this translation does not convey the true meaning of the 
     word. The closer meaning of the term nasihah is sincerity. That means that the entire religion is 
     encompassed by the concept of sincerity.
     The Prophet (sas) stated in the hadith that nasihah should be given to five categories: to Allah, His 
     Book, His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common people.</p>

     <h2>ARABIC TEXT</h2>
     <h3>الحديث السابع</h3>
     <p>عَنْ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَبِي حَفْصٍ عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ: 
        "إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ،
         وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا أَوْ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إلَيْهِ".</p>

     <h3><i>Al-Hadithul-Awwal</i></h3>
     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>On the authority of Tamim Al-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him):
     The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The religion is naseehah (sincerity)." We said, "To whom?"
      He (peace be upon him) said, "To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims an
     their common folk."
     [Muslim]</p>

<h1>HADITH 8</h1>
<h2>THEME: The Sanctity of a Muslim </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>It shows the distinction between being a Muslim outwardly and inwardly:
  Outwardly, a person is treated as Muslim if he declares faith and fulfills the main pillars.
  Inwardly, the judgment belongs to Allah, who knows the hearts.
  It clarifies the objective of jihad at the time of the Prophet ﷺ: not for conquest or power, but to remove obstacles preventing people from embracing Islam and to ensure that the basic practices of Islam are upheld.
  It also establishes the principle that a Muslim’s life and property are sacred unless they violate the laws of Islam.</p>

      <h3>الحديث الثامن</h3>
     <p>عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا أَنَّ رَسُوْلَ اللهِ قَالَ: (أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَشْهَدُوا أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدَ

     <h3><i>Al-Hadithul-Awwal</i></h3>
     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:
While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee against his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam."

Thereupon the man went of. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion."

<h1>HADITH 9</h1>
<h2>THEME: Obligations are According to Ability</h2>
<h2>INTRODUlCTION</h2>
 <p>There is another narration for this hadith that gives a deeper understanding of its meaning:
 The Messenger of Allah (sas) addressed us and said,
 O people! Hajj has been made obligatory upon you, so perform the Hajj. A man asked, "Is that every year, O Messenger of Allah?" The Prophet (sas) remained silent while the man repeated his question three times. Then he said, "If I had said 'yes' then it would have become obligatory upon you [i.e. every year], and you would not have been able to do so. Do not ask me about that which I have left unspecified, for verily the nations before you were destroyed by their excessive questioning and argumentation with their Prophets. If I order you with something then do as much of it as you are able, and if I forbid you from something then keep away from it."
 In both of these narrations, the prophet (sas) commands us to avoid what he has forbidden and to follow what he has ordered us to do according to the best of our ability.
 The Prophet (sas) also asks us to follow his guidance without asking too many questions, and to pay attention to the types of questions we ask.</p>

<h1>HADITH 10</h1>
<h2>THEME: Restricting Oneself to the Permissible</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>This hadith introduces the importance of al-tayyeb, that which is good or pure. The concept of purity and
     goodness applies to numerous aspects in our lives. As Muslims, we must be careful to enjoy only food 
     and clothing that are halal, use pure speech, and hold pure intentions.
     In popular cultures today, there are so many impure things around us. Indeed, such impurities have become 
     so common and widespread that we may actually think they are beneficial. Nevertheless, if something is 
     impure, then it cannot be good for us regardless of how many people like it or practice it. Our standards
     should not be set according to what most people say or do. Rather, they should be defined according to the
     revelation of Allah (swt).</p>

     or her. However, this is only so when the heart is clean. The believer who is truly seeking the pleasure

<h1>HADITH 12</h1>
<h2>THEME: Leaving that Which Does Not Concern You </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p>This hadith explains an important but often overlooked aspect of completing and perfecting our 
     practice of Islam. We should not concern ourselves with matters that are none of our business, 
     but should stay focused on the priorities that do concern us. When our practice of Islam becomes 
     more complete and more perfected, the good deeds we perform are multiplied to higher and higher exponents. By instilling this quality of focusing on what is of concern to you and disregarding what is not, deeds may become more weighty and valuable in the sight of Allah swt.
     One of the great scholars of the Maliki school of fiqh, Imam Abu Zaid al-Maliki, said that all 
     attributes of goodness stem from four hadiths[a]:
     The hadith in which the Prophet (sas) says to speak well or remain silent.
     The present hadith you are about to read.
     The hadith in which the Prophet (sas) said to a man asking for advice- “Do not get angry. Do not get angry. Do not get angry.”
     “You will not attain true belief until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.”
     This hadith outlines a valuable approach to life, especially in our age of information overload and 
     constant connection. In order to recognize the situations in which this characteristic can be applied, 
     you must practice a degree of sensitivity and humility. Shaikh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah mentions that 
     even when someone must cancel an appointment or meeting with you, it is inappropriate to ask why since 
     not every person can or wishes to explain the reason. Al-Hasan Al-Basri once said that one of the signs
      that Allah has turned away from a servant is that the servant finds himself continuously preoccupied 
      and engaged in matters which are none of his</p>

      accepting other’s advice and give advice in the best way. This is essential for the fabric of the

<h1>HADITH 16</h1>
<h2>THEME: The Forbiddance of Anger</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad (sas) knew that if a person controlled his anger he would be able to control everything else. 
    That is why the Prophet mentioned in another hadith: "The powerful man is not the one who can wrestle, but the powerful man is the one who can control himself at the time of anger."

<h1>HADITH 17</h1>
<h2>THEME: Prescription of Ihsan (Perfection)</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Islam commands Muslims to practice and apply Ihsan, striving for excellence, in all that they do. 
    Ihsan is so important that it was actually made obligatory, or wajib. It has been mentioned in the Quran, where Allah the Almighty says,
    Verily, Allah enjoins justice, and ihsan and giving help to relatives, and He forbids immoral sins, evil and tyranny. He admonishes you, so that perhaps you may take heed. (16:90)
    The structure of this hadith is very similar to the first one of Imam Al-Nawawi’s collection. 
    The Prophet (sas) spoke in the first Hadith about intentions, then he gave an example to clarify what he 
    meant by intentions. Likewise in this hadith, the Prophet (sas) speaks about ihsan and then gives an 
    example of what ihsan means and how to apply it.</p>

<h2>THEME: Follow Up a Bad Deed with a Good Deed</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>In this hadith, the Prophet (sas) teaches us that we must have God-consciousness in every possible scenario:
    “wherever you may be.” Whether you are alone, in public, in a position of leadership, weakness, or strength, 
    you should be aware and fearful that Allah is watching. This consciousness, keen awareness, 
    and fearfulness of God at every time and in every place is called taqwa.</p>

<h2>THEME:Be Mindful of Allah and Allah will Protect You </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    who would grow up to be an ocean of knowledge and for whom the Prophet said the prayer, “Allah, give him understanding of the religion, and teach him to discern its meanings.” 
    As we equip children with every means of success, we should not forget to imprint in their memory and hearts these powerful rules to live by.
    In another narration, the Prophet says, “Be mindful of Allah, you shall find Him in front of you. Know Allah in times of prosperity so He will know you in times of hardship. Know that whatever passed you by could never have happened, and what happened could never have been avoided. 
    Know that victory comes with patience, relief comes with affliction, and with hardship comes ease.”</p>

<h1>HADITH 20</h1>
<h2>THEME: Modesty is from Faith </h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p>In society, there remains some faint traces of the earliest Prophetic teachings. Prophet Muhammad (sas) in this hadith reminds us of one of those teachings, while also conveying an important message about heeding our internal compass of haya’.
     The Arabic word used here is haya’, and is often translated as modesty. However, Haya’ is more complex and dynamic than just modesty and encompasses many shades of meaning, including humility, sensitivity, shyness, apprehensiveness, and shame.
     We know that all of the Prophets are interconnected. They came with the same message, a universal call to worship the one true God. The concept of haya’ is neither new and invented, nor exclusive to Islam. The Prophet (sas) said, “I was sent to perfect good character.” From this, we learn that good character and manners is a component of society, and earlier prophets also emphasized good moral character.</p>

<p>This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and understanding and shows the balance between the internal and external
     states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam 
     revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because 
     the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is 
     one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this 
     hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is

         Allah and His Messenger, his migration is to Allah and His Messenger; but he whose migration was for 
         some worldly thing he might gain, or for a wife he might marry, his migration is to that for which he
          migrated." [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

<h2>THEME:  ًWay to Entering Paradise</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p>This hadith lays down the principle of balance in religion.
     It teaches that Allah has:

     Obligations (fara’id) – duties like prayer, fasting, zakah.

     Limits (hudood) – boundaries not to be crossed, such as prohibitions.

     Silences – matters not mentioned, left out of mercy, so we should not over-question or invent rules.

     It emphasizes that Islam is complete and sufficient, without need for additions or excessiveness.

     It guides Muslims to follow what is clear, avoid what is forbidden, and not overburden themselves with unnecessary doubts or innovations.</p>

    return back to this hadith due to it encompassing knowledge of the Sunnah. Hence, some of the scholars 
     have termed this hadith the Mother or Core of the Sunnah, just as Surah al-Fatiha has been termed the

     when he came to the Prophet (sas), asking a set of questions. The Prophet (sas) responded to those questions
     and then addressed his companions. There is a door called “Baab Jibreel” at Masjid An-Nabawi in Madina.

<h1>HADITH 25</h1>
<h2>THEME: The Value of Charity</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
     <p>This hadith draws our attention to how the Companions sought to compete with one another for the 
     hereafter and in seeking the reward of Allah (swt). The level of concern the Companions of the 
     Prophet (sas) had to constantly seek opportunities to carry out good deeds is evident in this hadith.
     Although there is nothing wrong with wanting to be wealthy with the intention that we may give in
     charity and gain reward from Allah (swt), the Prophet (sas) directs our attention to how Allah (swt)
     has provided many ways a believer can give in charity regardless of one’s situation in life. 
     Remembering Allah (swt), benefitting others and performing acts in a permissible way are all 
     considered charity. Our concern should be seeking the Pleasure of Allah (swt) in as many ways as 
     possible.</p>

     without burdening or boring them. The Prophet (sas) was very eloquent. Ibn Rajab points out the

     understandable manner. He (sas) had the ability to deliver a very powerful message in a very impactful 
     manner. That is why his companions said that their hearts became fearful and their eyes became tearful.

<h1>HADITH 29</h1>
<h2>THEME: Means of Goodness</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>This hadith presents Islam as a complete structure, comparing it to a tent or building:

 Head of the matter → Islam (the foundation of life).

 Pillar → Prayer (the central support of faith).

 Peak → Jihad (striving for Allah’s cause, the highest level of sacrifice).

 Then the Prophet ﷺ highlights the key to preserving it all: guarding one’s tongue.

 It teaches that faith is not only about worship and struggle but also about controlling speech, since careless words can destroy good deeds.

 In short, this hadith summarizes the essence of Islam: faith, worship, sacrifice, and discipline of the tongue — without which all else can collapse.</p>

     <p>On the authority of Muadh bin Jabal (may Allah be please with him) who said:
     I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from the Hellfire.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'You have asked me about a great matter, yet it is easy for him for whom Allah makes it easy. Worship Allah without associating any partners with Him; establish the prayer; pay the Zakah; fast in Ramadan; and make the pilgrimage to the House.'
     "Then he (peace be upon him) said, 'Shall I not guide you towards the means of goodness? Fasting is a shield, charity wipes away sin as water extinguishes fire, and the praying of a man in the depths of the night.' Then he (peace be upon him) recited: '[Those] who forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allah's cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do' [as-Sajdah, 16-17].
     "Then he (peace be upon him) said, 'Shall I not inform you of the head of the matter, its pillar and its peak?' I said, 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the prayer and its peak is jihad.' Then he (peace be upon him) said, 'Shall I not tell you of the foundation of all of that?' I said, 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' So he took hold of his tongue and said, 'Restrain this.' I said, 'O Prophet of Allah, will we be taken to account for what we say with it?' He (peace be upon him) said, 'May your mother be bereaved of you, O Muadh! Is there anything that throws people into the Hellfire upon their faces, or on their noses, except the harvests of their tongues?'

<h1>HADITH 30</h1>
<h2>THEME: Do Not Neglect the Religious Obligations</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This hadith lays down the principle of balance in religion.

It teaches that Allah has:

Obligations (fara’id) – duties like prayer, fasting, zakah.

Limits (hudood) – boundaries not to be crossed, such as prohibitions.

Silences – matters not mentioned, left out of mercy, so we should not over-question or invent rules.

It emphasizes that Islam is complete and sufficient, without need for additions or excessiveness.

It guides Muslims to follow what is clear, avoid what is forbidden, and not overburden themselves with unnecessary doubts or innovations.</p>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so."
The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman."
He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He said, "You have spoken truly."
Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you."
He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went of. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better."

<p>This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and understanding and shows the balance between the internal and external
     states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam 
     revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because 
     the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is 
     one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this 
     hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is

     <p>It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:
While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee against his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam."
The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so."
The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman."
He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He said, "You have spoken truly."
Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you."
He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went of. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion."

<h1>HADITH 39</h1>
<h2>THEME: SIGNIFICANCE OF SINCERITY AND GOOD INTENTION</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and understanding and shows the balance between the internal and external
     states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam 
     revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because 
     the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is 
     one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this 
     hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is 
     clear and the Haram is clear and between them are doubtful matters”(1), and “Whoever innovates in this 
     religion that which is not from it will have all his actions rejected (by Allah).”(2)</p>

         who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, say: "Actions are (judged) by

      <h3>الحديث الثاني</h3>
     <p>عَنْ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَيْضًا قَالَ:
        " بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ جُلُوسٌ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم ذَاتَ يَوْم
        ، إذْ طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا رَجُلٌ شَدِيدُ بَيَاضِ الثِّيَابِ، شَدِيدُ سَوَادِ الشَّعْرِ، لَا يُرَى عَلَيْهِ أَثَرُ السَّفَرِ، وَلَا يَعْرِفُهُ مِنَّا أَحَدٌ
        . حَتَّى جَلَسَ إلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم . فَأَسْنَدَ رُكْبَتَيْهِ إلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ، وَوَضَعَ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى فَخِذَيْهِ،:
     وَقَالَ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِسْلَامِ.فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم الْإِسْلَامُ أَنْ تَشْهَدَ أَنْ لَا إلَهَ إلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ
     ، وَتُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِيَ الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومَ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجَّ الْبَيْتَ إنْ اسْتَطَعْت إلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا.قَالَ: صَدَقْت . فَعَجِبْنَا لَهُ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيُصَدِّقُهُ!"قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِيمَانِ..قَالَ: أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ بِاَللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ، وَتُؤْمِنَ بِالْقَدَرِ خَيْرِهِ وَشَرِّهِ.قَالَ: صَدَقْت. قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِحْسَانِ.قَالَ: أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ كَأَنَّك تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك.قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ السَّاعَةِ. قَالَ: مَا الْمَسْئُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنْ السَّائِلِ.قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ أَمَارَاتِهَا؟ قَالَ: أَنْ تَلِدَ الْأَمَةُ رَبَّتَهَا، وَأَنْ تَرَى الْحُفَاةَ الْعُرَاةَ الْعَالَةَ رِعَاءَ الشَّاءِ يَتَطَاوَلُونَ فِي الْبُنْيَانِ. ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ، فَلَبِثْتُ مَلِيًّا،ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا عُمَرُ أَتَدْرِي مَنْ السَّائِلُ؟.فقلت اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ.قَالَ: فَإِنَّهُ جِبْرِيلُ أَتَاكُمْ يُعَلِّمُكُمْ دِينَكُمْ ".[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]</p>

     <h2>Translation</h2>
     <p>It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:
While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee against his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam."
The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so."
The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman."
He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He said, "You have spoken truly."
Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you."
He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went of. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion."
